# I AM RICH

Hi there!
This is my project series with Flutter. I create this project for learning purpose. So, this is the first app in this series. I create app with three image and three buttons. The images will change base on the button click. This is pretty simple app but it's so beautiful.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
